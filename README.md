# Cellular Automata Simulator

This program visualizes and simulates user-defined behaviors for cellular automata via scripting in Lua.

## Building

### Dependencies
   - SFML 2.5
   - sol2 (version 3)

   Running `make package` should give you a runnable copy in the `dist` folder (Makefile hasn't been made yet, will be added soon, so this currently won't work)
